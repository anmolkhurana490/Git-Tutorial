# Git States

Git has three main states that your files can reside in: modified, staged, and committed:

- ***Modified*** means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet.

- ***Staged*** means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.

- ***Committed (Unmodified)*** means that the data is safely stored in your local database.

- ***Untracked*** is a file that is not being tracked by Git and is not part of the Git repository
